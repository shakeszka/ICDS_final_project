This project, Monogram, features a comprehensive chat system (like Telegram and WhatsApp), equipped with a full range of messaging functionalities, along with some unique additions.

Monogram's extensions also feature a graphical user interface (GUI), public key encryption, a snake game. Also, if you like the project, you can use the script for two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game included in this repository to integrate it to the existing GUI. Good luck!
